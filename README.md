# MyMachineLearningProject
This is a Machine Learning project that predicts the final exam mark of students using a UCI Students Performance Dataset.
The academic life of students has been gradually affected negatively by the increasing distractions of the developing society. As a result, their grades in education become unpleasant and discouraging. With the application of Artificial Intelligence, this problem can be approached. Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence that refers to the ability of a system to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning can be used to predict the students' future results with the use of its various techniques for example Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, Decision Trees and so on. With such a capability, students and the institution as a whole are able to tell whether they are on the right track or not and adjust accordingly.
